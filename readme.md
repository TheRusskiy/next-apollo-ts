# next-apollo-ts starter kit

## Differences with the "official" next.js + apollo example:

* Typescript.
* Automatic type generation from graphql queries.
* Support for Apollo on pages with `getStaticProps` without a need to know and load all queries. Addresses https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/11957.
* Prevent apollo queries running twice for `fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network'`, once on SSR then on CSR. Apollo won't run network queries until a page is mounted. IMHO it's preferred solution to `ssrForceFetchDelay`.
* When doing a client side navigation to pages that were generated statically Apollo doesn't fire a new query to load data, instead it uses data that was pre-generated by merging it into apollo cache.
* Addresses shortcomings of `revalidate` (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/11552#discussioncomment-53779) by checking when the data was last fetched. If it was fetch longer than the `revalidate` period, we trigger a query from client-side to load up-to-date data on queries with `fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network'`.
* Eslint config.
* Styled-components integration.
